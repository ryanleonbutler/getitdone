# getitdone

### About
**getitdone** command line to-do list app... now let's make some lists!

I was browsing on the Internet and wanted a really basic todo list application, which was free and opensource. Since I am in the process of learning more about software development I decided to create my own.


### Installation
```
$ pip install getitdone
```

### Uninstall
```
$ pip uninstall getitdone
```
